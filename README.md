UNP_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_ENGINEERING_STUDENT_SALARY_DATA

ENGINEERING STUDENT SALARY DATA- The goal of the project is to predict the salary of an engineering student using machine learning models in Python. Various algorithms, including KNN Classifier, Decision Trees, Regression, and Random Forest, will be applied to a dataset containing features such as years of experience, academic performance, skills, and more. The model's performance will be evaluated using a train-test split.Handled missing data,Encode categorical variables,Scale numerical data for consistency,Split the data into features (X) and the target variables and then divide into training and testing sets.Initial data exploration to understand patterns, visualize relationships, and identify missing values or outliers in the dataset.Initial data exploration to understand patterns, visualize relationships, and identify missing values or outliers in the dataset. Apply the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, though typically used for classification, it may be adapted for salary categories.Decision Trees a non-linear model to capture feature interactions.A basic regression model for predicting salary based on continuous variables.An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.Test the models on the test data and evaluate performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²), or Mean Absolute Error (MAE). After testing all models, you will compare their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting engineering student salaries. The best-performing model will be identified, and further recommendations for model improvement or feature enhancement will be suggested.
